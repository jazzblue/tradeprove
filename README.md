## Description

This repo is for code demonstration purposes only.

The project is built using Django, a high level Python based Web framework.

Most of Python and Javascript code are in the **specify** app.

Other apps are work-in-progress and this repo has only their basic implementation. Their latest code is yet to be committed.

The Javascript code could be found in *specify/static/specify* directory.

Note on CSS:

In the *specify* app the CSS attributes are defined in Javascript using JSON format and assigned within Javascript code rather than in CSS file. This is to keep both constant and generically parametrized CSS attributes in one place (Javascript code). Therefore, at the moment *specify* app has no CSS file.
