## Description

This repo is for code demonstration purposes only.

The project is built using Django, a high level Python based Web framework. It is still work-in-progress.

*Specify* app has most of its implementation completed, therefore, most of Python and Javascript code are in the *specify* app.

For other apps this repo has only their basic implementation and the latest code is yet to be committed.

The Javascript code for *specify* app could be found in *specify/static/specify* directory.

Note on CSS:

In the *specify* app the CSS attributes are defined in Javascript using JSON format structure and are assigned within Javascript code rather than in CSS file. This is to keep both constant and generically parametrized CSS attributes in one place (Javascript code). Therefore, at the moment *specify* app has no separate CSS file.
